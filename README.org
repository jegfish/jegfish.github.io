** TODO Build PDFs
*** TODO Build PDFs
*** TODO Build collated PDF of all pages
At least all articles. If possible also other pages like About.

*** TODO Add link to all pages to get PDF version of it
Part of a template so don't have to manually write it on all the pages.

At least have this thing show up on blog posts.

** TODO Try to get RSS to include full articles
If it's a pain, not gonna try too hard on this one.

** TODO Setup tag list page

Technically it's easy to make a non-blog post, but the part I couldn't figure out was not showing name/publish date.

This is accomplished with the =hidemeta: true= configuration option.
