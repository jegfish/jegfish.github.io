title: Extra resources
---

- [Processing foundation](https://processing.org/)
	- The graphics library we are using is based on the Processing libraries. There are tutorials, books, and other resources on their website.
- [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)
	- A YouTube channel by Daniel Shiffman that has a lot of creative coding (what we're doing) learning resources.
	- Some of his videos are in the Java version of Processing, but many of his videos are in `p5.js` (the library we are using).
		- Note: Java is not JavaScript. They have similar names but they are very different. You may still benefit from his videos done in Java, but he has plenty of `p5.js` JavaScript videos.
