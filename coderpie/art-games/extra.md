title: Extra resources

- [Processing foundation](https://processing.org/)
	- The graphics library we are using is based on the Processing libraries. There are tutorials, books, and other resources on their website.
- [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)
	- A YouTube channel by Daniel Shiffman that has a lot of creative coding (what we're doing) learning resources.
	- He uses Processing (the same library we are using), but usually in Java or JavaScript. From Python, JavaScript is easier to learn than Java is.
